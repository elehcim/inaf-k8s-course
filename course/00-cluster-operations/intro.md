# Welcome !

In this scenario we'll learn how to interact with the kubernetes cluster.


### A bit of history...

The [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) project was started by Google in 2014, and it was based on the experience they had with their internal container orchestration system, called Borg.
They wanted an orchestrator with this set of essential features ([source](https://www.opsramp.com/guides/why-kubernetes/who-made-kubernetes)): 

- Replication: to deploy multiple instances of an application
- Load balancing and service discovery: to route traffic to these replicated containers
- Basic health checking and repair: to ensure a self-healing system
- Scheduling: to group many machines into a single pool and distribute work to them

Kubernetes is a Greek word meaning 'captain' in English. Like the captain is responsible for the safe journey of the ship in the seas, Kubernetes is responsible for carrying and delivering _containers_ safely to locations where they can be used. Kubernetes is often shortened as k8s (because of the 8 letters beween the _k_ and the _s_).
The first [commit](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/2c4b3a562ce34cddc3f8218a2c4d11c7310e6d56) was made the 7th of June 2014.

In 2018, coinciding with the release of Kubernetes 1.0, the development was handed over to the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/), a non-profitan open-source software foundation that promotes and advances the adoption of cloud-native computing.
The CNCF is part of the Linux Foundation.
See here [the Cloud Native definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/DEFINITION.md).

K8s is the second largest open source project in the world, after the Linux kernel.
