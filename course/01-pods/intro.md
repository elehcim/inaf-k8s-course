Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes.
They run one or more containers on a single node, and they are the building blocks of the cluster.

Pods are created and managed by the Kubernetes API server component, which is the control plane of the cluster.
The API server is the main management unit of the cluster, and is responsible for all the operations that happen in the cluster.
